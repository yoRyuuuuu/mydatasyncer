  # Mapping between file columns and database columns
  # Described in YAML list format.
  # The order of this list is expected to correspond to the order of columns in CSV files.
  # For JSON or YAML files, values with keys included in this list will be loaded.
  columns:
    - "id" # File column 1 -> DB id column
    - "name" # File column 2 -> DB name column
    - "price" # File column 3 -> DB price column

  # Column name to be used as the table's primary key
  # Required for determining data identity when performing differential updates (syncMode: diff).
  primaryKey: "id"

  # Specify the synchronization mode
  # "overwrite": Deletes all data in the database table and then inserts all contents from the file.
  # "diff": Compares the contents of the file with the database and applies only the differences (additions, updates, deletions).
  syncMode: "diff"

  # Option for differential update mode (diff)
  # If set to true, data in the database with a primary key that doesn't exist in the file will be deleted.
  # If set to false, such data will not be deleted.
  deleteNotInFile: true
